# EusQuAD - Automatically Translated and Aligned SQuAD2.0 for Basque

EuSQuAD, is a version of [SQuAD2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) for Basque.
Our approach is based on machine-translating the original corpus with a generic neural machine translation system, 
addressing mismatches between context and answers via semantic text similarity.
The resulting dataset is of the same size as the original SQuAD2.0 dataset (over 142k question-answer pairs), readily usable for QA-related tasks in Basque.

## Format and usage

EuSQuAD has the same json format and structure than the original SQuAD2.0, so it should be possible to use the same code and tools to load and use it.
